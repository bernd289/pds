# Account Migration 

### ⚠️ Warning ⚠️ ️
Account migration is a potentially destructive operation. Part of the operation involves signing away your old PDS's ability to make updates to your DID. If something goes wrong, you could be permanently locked out of your account, and Bluesky will not be able to help you recover it. 

Therefore, we do not recommend migrating your primary account yet. And we specifically recommend _against_ migrating your main account if you do not understand how PLC operations work.

Also, the Bluesky PDS is not currently accepting incoming migrations (it will in the future). Therefore this is currently a one-way street. If you migrate off of `bsky.social`, _you will not be able to return_. However, you will be able to migrate between other PDSs.
